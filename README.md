## About

This database offers traces that complement the paper titled "SPA-GPT: General Pulse Tailor for Simple Power
Analysis Based on Reinforcement Learning" . The database includes five traces (software/hardware/software-hardware co-design) of RSA and
one trace of ECC. The trace of Kyber can be found in [link]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OsDaXpcQ7VVsuLL5z4eAcujq6uANXbRA/view?usp=sharing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9591340)

>  📌NOTE📌: Due to limited memory size, traces of AT89S52_ECC Only includes the parts related to the private key; SAKURA-G platform has minimal noise impact, and without any protection, it only requires a single trace to recover the private key.

For the explanation of the .h5 file structure, we will use the example of 1-CARD_RSA.h5:

```
├─ 1-card-RSA
│  ├─ metadata
│  ├─ ├─ D
│  ├─ ├─ E
│  ├─ ├─ N
│  ├─ ├─ ciphertext
│  ├─ traces
│  ├─ ├─ CARD_RSA_for_paper
│  ├─ ├─ CARD_RSA_original
```

Explanation for each group:

`metadata`: If a black box device is used, the dataset inside contains only one data point, which is -1. If other data exists, it will be in the form of an array, where each element is a single byte.

`traces`: It stores trace data. In this example, `CARD_RSA_for_paper` contains trace used in the paper, while `CARD_RSA_original contains` original traces collected using an oscilloscope.

**②readH5.py**📃 is a Python example program for reading .h5 files.

**③readH5.m**📃 is a MATLAB example program for reading .h5 files.

**④HDFView.7z** 📃 is a desktop application for visualizing .h5 file. The version provided here is for Windows; simply double-click the .bat script file to open it.

## For paper

The table below illustrates the **processing** applied to the traces used **in our paper**.

> 📌NOTE📌: The processing methods in the table apply only to the **_for_paper.h5 data.

We use the following formula for low-pass filtering. The meaning of the parameter "low-pass filtered" is 𝑤, and 𝑆𝑖 Indicates the value of the 𝑖th point in the trace.

$$
s_i=\frac{w * s_{i-1}+s_i}{1+w}
